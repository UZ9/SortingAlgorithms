# SortingAlgorithms
A list of different Java sorting algorithms (Visualizer coming soon!)

A small utility for myself when I need sorting algorithms. 

Current algorithms:
- BinarySearch
- SequentialSearch (This is really just a loop, only for time reference)
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- QuickSort
- SelectionSort
